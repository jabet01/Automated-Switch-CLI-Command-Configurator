For computer networks to function smoothly and operate effectively, network administration is essential. The core tool for administering and setting up Cisco switch, which are essential components of many networks,
is the Cisco IOS command-line interface (CLI). Even while the CLI is incredibly powerful and versatile, manually executing commands can be laborious and prone to mistakes, particularly in complicated configurations. 
Automated CLI commands become a strong option to deal with these issues because they reduce the possibility of human error and streamline repeated processes.

The manual CLI command execution process takes a long time, which is a common characteristic of the current state of network management. A considerable amount of time is spent by network administrators manually typing CLI commands,
which raises labour expenses and may cause delays in network operations. Furthermore, misconfigurations can be introduced by human mistake, which is a natural part of manual procedures and can result in network outages and other disturbances. 
These difficulties demonstrate the necessity of a more automated method of network administration.

An effective strategy to overcome these difficulties is to use automated CLI commands, which completely change the way network managers communicate with Cisco switch. Automated CLI commands drastically cut down on the amount of time 
and effort needed for network maintenance by automating repeated chores. This optimizes labour expenses and speeds up network operations so that it can react quickly to shifting network demands.

Additionally, the risks related to human error are significantly mitigated by automated CLI commands. Automated CLI commands significantly lower the possibility of misconfigurations by doing away with the necessity for manual command entry, 
which helps to create a more dependable and stable network environment. Furthermore, the automation of CLI commands ensures that configurations are current and standardized, encouraging consistency throughout network devices.

The shortcomings of manually executing CLI commands are essentially addressed by automated CLI commands, which usher in a new era of efficiency, accuracy, and dependability in network management. Network administrators can optimize their operations, 
improve network performance, and guarantee the uninterrupted delivery of essential network services by utilizing automated CLI commands. These commands also reduce human error and foster consistency by automating repetitive tasks.
